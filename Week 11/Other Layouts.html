<p>Android provides other types of layouts. Here is a short list:</p>
<h3>TableLayout</h3>
<p>A Layout that arranges its children into rows and columns.</p>
<p>TableLayout is a ViewGroup that displays child View elements in rows and columns.</p>

<h3>FrameLayout</h3>
<p>A Layout that places its children on top of each other so that the latest child is covering the previous. Think of a deck of cards; just like that.</p>
<h3>AbsoluteLayout</h3>
<p>A Layout that lets you specify exact locations (x/y coordinates) of its children. Absolute layouts are less flexible and harder to maintain than other types of layouts with absolute positioning.</p>
