<h1>Hardware</h1>
<p>1. Make the circuit as shown in "OneShiftRegisterWiringDiagram"</p>
<p>2. The shift register has 8 outputs. Wire each output to a LED that is protected by a resistor.</p>
<ol>
<li>QA &gt; resistor &gt; LED #1</li>
<li>QB &gt; wire &gt; resistor &gt; LED #2</li>
<li>QC &gt; wire &gt; resistor &gt; LED #3</li>
<li>QD &gt; wire &gt; resistor &gt; LED #4</li>
<li>QE &gt; wire &gt; resistor &gt; LED #5</li>
<li>QF &gt; wire &gt; resistor &gt; LED #6</li>
<li>QG &gt; wire &gt; resistor &gt; LED #7</li>
<li>QH &gt; wire &gt; resistor &gt; LED #8</li>
</ol>
<h1>Software</h1>
<p>The code listing on Slide 19 of Lecture 5 toggles the first LED.</p>
<p>The code listing on Slide 16 of Lecture 5 shows you how to loop for 8-bits, which equals 1 byte.</p>
<p>Next, apply what you just learned, and make</p>
<p>Now apply what you just learned. Write code that will light each of the 8 LEDs one at a time --- going up, and then down.</p>
<p>To see the behaviour of how the demo is suppose to work, see the reference movies ("ShiftRegisteDemos.zip").</p>
