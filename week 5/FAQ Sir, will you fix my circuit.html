<p>Q: I've done everything.... I followed your example, I tried this, I tried that. Will you fix my circuit?</p>
<p>A: Yes, but at a co$t to you. I call it the "Santa Clause" clause.</p>
<p>I will bring your circuit to my work-shop, fix it, and return it to you. Your lab mark will be capped at 40%. Meaning, your mark for this lab will not exceed 40 / 100.</p>
<p>If I can't fix your circuit: 100% on the lab, plus 1% on your final mark for "pain and suffering".</p>
