<h2>Explore Your Android Studio Project</h2>
<p>Open the&nbsp;<strong>Project</strong>&nbsp;window: View &gt; Tool Windows &gt; Project</p>
<p>And the&nbsp;<strong>Android</strong>&nbsp;view is selected from the drop-down list at the top of that window.</p>
<p>You can then see the following files:</p>
<p><strong>app &gt; java &gt; com.algonquincollege.hurdleg.myfirstapp &gt; MainActivity.java</strong>: This is the main activity (the entry point of your app). When you build and run the app, the system launches an instace of this Activity and loads its layout.</p>
<p><strong>gen</strong>&nbsp;[Generated Java Files] -&gt; R.java: the generated R values; links the layout XML files to the Activity source files in src. Do not modify the contents of this folder.</p>
<p><strong>res &gt; layout &gt; activity_main.xml</strong>: This XML file defines the layout for the activity's UI. It contains a TextView element with the text "Hello World!".</p>
<p><strong>res &gt; values &gt; strings.xml</strong>: defines the app's string resources.</p>
<p><strong>manifests &gt; AndroidManifest.xml</strong>: The manifest file describes the fundamental characteristics of the app and defines each of its components. Expressed in a different way: defines the meta information for the Android project.</p>
<p><strong>Gradle Scripts&nbsp;&gt; build.gradle</strong>: You'll see two files with this name: one for the project and one for the "app" module. Each module has its own build.gradle file, but this project currenty has just one module. You'll mostly work with the module's build.gradle file to configure how the Gradle tools compile and build your app. For more information about this file, see&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/build/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Configure Your Build</a></p>
